# CloudFunctions
The first cloud function to notify users for messages, friend requests and comments.

Copied together and really happy that this function works. The possibilities with cloud functions are huge, so we hope there are some volunteers who got some experience with Typescript/Javascript.

For example, implementation for notifications on follow-up comments for a post you commented or a basic algorithm for the main feed, so we can implement it to "follow" a topic and friends, to get a bit more individualisation on the feed.

If you are motivated, please let us know! We would be very happy about every message and interaction :)
